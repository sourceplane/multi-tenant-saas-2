# cms — runbook

## How it deploys

A merge to `main` that changes `apps/cms` deploys stage, then prod, in the
CMS's own lane, after `cloudflare-hyperdrive-cms` and `db-migrate` for that
environment. The lane builds, renders the wrangler config from the published
wiring, runs `wrangler deploy`, pushes the runtime secrets, and smoke-checks
`/health` and `/admin` (retried for about 4.5 minutes). Pull requests build,
typecheck and dry-run the deploy; nothing deploys from a pull request.

## Open the admin (first account)

The CMS ships closed: nobody can create the first account until the owner opens
setup. Once per environment:

1. Choose a token of at least 16 characters, and keep it to yourself.
2. Give it to the Worker, either way:
   - in the workspace's secrets for that environment, as `CMS_SETUP_TOKEN`; the
     next CMS deploy pushes it; or
   - directly: `pnpm exec wrangler secret put CMS_SETUP_TOKEN --name multi-tenant-saas-2-cms-<env>`
     (it prompts for the value).
3. Visit `https://multi-tenant-saas-2-cms-<env>.nexo-7be.workers.dev/setup?token=<token>`.
   It sets a 15-minute cookie and sends you to `/admin/create-first-user`.
4. Create the account. It becomes an admin. From then on, admins create every
   other account in `/admin`, and setup is irrelevant.

You can delete `CMS_SETUP_TOKEN` afterwards; nothing needs it.

## Verify

```bash
B=https://multi-tenant-saas-2-cms-stage.nexo-7be.workers.dev
curl -fsS $B/health                                   # {"status":"ok","db":"ok"}
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' $B/admin      # 200
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST $B/api/users/first-register \
  -H content-type:application/json -d '{"email":"x@example.com","password":"x"}'   # 403
curl -fsS "$B/api/pages?limit=5"                      # published pages only
```

## Change a collection

1. Edit the collection in `src/collections/` and run the app locally (below).
2. `pnpm payload migrate:create <name>` writes a migration and snapshot to
   `payload-migrations/`.
3. Convert it: `node scripts/payload-migration-to-sql.mjs payload-migrations/<file>.ts > ../../packages/db/src/migrations/<id>/up.sql`.
   Exit code 2 means a statement could not be made idempotent (a drop, rename
   or type change): rewrite it by hand into a safe, re-runnable form and say so
   in the pull request.
4. Add `<id>` to `packages/db/src/manifest.ts` with `context: "cms"` and the
   file's sha256, and to `CONVERTED` in `tests/cms/src/migration-sync.test.ts`.
5. `pnpm generate:types` and `pnpm generate:importmap` if fields or admin
   components changed.

## Run it locally

```bash
# Postgres 16 on 127.0.0.1:54329 with a database `cms`, then:
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:<pw>@127.0.0.1:54329/cms
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f ../../packages/db/src/migrations/200_cms_payload_core/up.sql
pnpm dev                                        # Node, http://localhost:3002

# The real runtime (workerd), after `pnpm build`:
node ../../tooling/wire/render.mjs --template wrangler.template.jsonc --out wrangler.jsonc --map wiring.fixture.json
printf 'PAYLOAD_SECRET=%s\nCMS_SETUP_TOKEN=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -hex 24)" "$(openssl rand -hex 16)" > .dev.vars
CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_HYPERDRIVE_CMS="$DATABASE_URL" \
  pnpm exec wrangler dev --config wrangler.jsonc --env stage --port 8799
```

`wrangler dev` needs a password in the local connection string.

## Common failures

- **Smoke: `/health` answers 503.** The body names the part that failed, and
  the Worker's logs (observability is on) carry the error:
  - `{"secret":"missing"}`: `PAYLOAD_SECRET` is not on the Worker. `secrets-live`
    pushes it right after `wrangler deploy`; if it reported the secret as "not
    seeded", `cloudflare-hyperdrive-cms` has not published `CMS_PAYLOAD_SECRET`
    for that environment yet.
  - `{"payload":"error"}`: Payload could not start, which on a deployed Worker
    is almost always the database being unreachable at startup.
  - `{"db":"error"}`: Payload started but the query failed: check that
    `cloudflare-hyperdrive-cms` applied, that the deploy rendered the right
    `HYPERDRIVE_CMS` id, and that db-migrate applied migration 200.
- **Deploy: "exceeds the size limit" or CPU errors (1102).** The account is on
  Workers Free. The CMS needs Workers Paid.
- **Requests hang for 10 s, then 500.** A regression to a shared pool: the
  adapter must get `requestScopedPg` on Workers (`src/payload.config.ts`), and
  `cms-tests`' `request-scoped-pool` suite should have caught it.
- **Build: "Failed to collect configuration … connectionString".** Something at
  build time reached for the binding: `src/lib/runtime.ts` must keep
  `NEXT_PHASE=phase-production-build` out of the Workers branch.
